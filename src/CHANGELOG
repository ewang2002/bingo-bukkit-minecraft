
1.1.0
 Optional time-based reward decrease.
 Players now receive a stack of golden carrots alongside their iron tools.
 Adjusted listener to now register taking items from other inventories, like when using a stonecutter or looting a chest.
 Added a configurable increase to furnaces' smelting speed.
 Bug fixes:
  If your inventory was completely full, you would receive credit when shift clicking a crafting result, although it would not actually do the craft.
  Clicking the result of a craft with a different item would give you credit for the craft without it occuring.
  Text on startup used incorrect title.
